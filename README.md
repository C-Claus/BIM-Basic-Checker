# Basic BIM Checker
A growing number of players in the construction sector are taking part in the initiative to make use of a basic information delivery manual. The BIM Loket supports this initiative wholeheartedly. This small Add-In is trying to facilitate applying the BIM Basic IDM for everyone. It is a simple lightweight Revit Add-In to check for Categories, 0-Points, Levels, FireRating, Assembly Code and show materials. The Add-In does not produce a simple checklist, it is meant for the Revit user who is able to highlight the unspecified and unclassified elements to conform to a 3D model which meets the Basic IDM (Dutch: Basis ILS) requirements.


**Why does this Revit Add-in exist?**

In order to secure and reuse information more efficiently and effectively to share information unambiguously.

**Installers**

Installers can be found here:

[Installer for Revit 2017](https://github.com/C-Claus/BasicBIMChecker/blob/master/Basic_BIM_Checker_installer_REVIT_2017.exe)

[Installer for Revit 2018](https://github.com/C-Claus/BasicBIMChecker/blob/master/Basic_BIM_Checker_installer_REVIT_2018.exe) <- it will give a meaningless error when starting Revit.
