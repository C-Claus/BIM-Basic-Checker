# Basic BIM Checker
A growing number of players in the construction sector are taking part in the initiative to make use of a basic information delivery manual. The BIM Loket supports this initiative wholeheartedly. This small Add-In is trying to facilitate applying the BIM Basic IDM for everyone. It is a simple lightweight Revit Add-In to check for Categories, 0-Points, Levels, FireRating, Assembly Code and show materials.


**Why does this Revit Add-in exist?**

In order to secure and reuse information more efficiently and effectively to share information unambiguously.
